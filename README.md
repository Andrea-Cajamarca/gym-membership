CSCI 233 Seminar Minor Project

Group 5 - Gym Membership Group are collaborating to create a gym membership site that will allow users to utlize the gym's membership perks based on the different selection of membership options are available. There is also a way for trainers to create their personal workout schedules and customize their schedules based on the given selection and rooms availble in the gym site. Users will be able to selected and sign up for workouts, but trainers will be the one to finally confirm the date and time on their end. Staff/admin will be given their own login that will allow them to update user information, handle comments and issues from either user or trainers, and update the website to better reflect the current sitation. Admin will have the most access across the site while staff will handle customer service and feeback.
